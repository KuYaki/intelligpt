## Current Status
The current version of IntelliGPT includes a basic user interface with essential elements, such as input fields and buttons. However, there are several crucial features yet to be implemented:

1. **Tooltips for buttons**: Improve the user experience by providing helpful hints on the purpose and functionality of each button in the interface.
2. **Button transition animations**: Add smooth animations when transitioning between buttons (e.g., switching from the voice input button to the send button).
3. **Authentication**: Implement a secure authentication mechanism for users to access the GPT API.
4. **GPT functions**: Extend the plugin's capabilities by adding the following GPT-driven features:
   - Add and remove files in the project.
   - Open specific files.
   - Copy code to the clipboard and create diffs between the current code and the clipboard content.
   - Request the content of a file.
5. **GPT prompts**: Refine GPT's output by crafting efficient prompts, ensuring that it focuses on relevant information and effectively utilizes its available functions.
6. **Microphone access**: Implement microphone access and integration for voice input functionality.
7. **Voice command input**: Allow users to issue voice commands to control the plugin and interact with GPT more efficiently.

## Roadmap
The following roadmap outlines the future development of IntelliGPT:

1. Implement the remaining features listed above to complete the initial version of the plugin.
2. Continuously improve and optimize the user interface based on user feedback.
3. Expand the plugin's functionality and capabilities by incorporating more GPT-driven features.
4. Maintain the plugin by fixing bugs, addressing user issues, and keeping it up-to-date with the latest GPT API changes.
